# React Craco Antd

I've created this basic create react app + craco antd + nodemon repo to ease use of ant design for myself in the future by avoiding to have to go through the setup again when starting a new project using these modules. The modules used in this are not my work, I've just followed the guide at [npm craco-ant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/craco-antd) implementing the bare minimum to start a new project.\
<br/>

## Details

Thanks to all the people who look after these modules and make life a bit easier. All linked below to npm.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and download npm modules.
<br/><br/>

## Prerequisites

None
<br/><br/>

## Installation

1. Clone the repo

   git clone https://github.com/moms-spaghetti/react_craco_antd.git
   ```
2. Download the required npm modules

   <br/>

## Usage

Adjust the config for craco.config.js at ./craco.config.js.\
Add antd less variables at ./src/style/AntDesign/customTheme.less to change theme settings.\
Nodemon is watching for changes to both above files. Making changes will reset the server and show new changes.\
New tab on restart has been disabled in ./craco.config.js. Remove the line process.env.BROWSER = "none" if you don't want this behaviour.\
Once npm modules have been updated you can begin building.
